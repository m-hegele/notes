Scenarios:

- [x] 1 A gap 
  - fix: properly updating rcur_measured only if currents are 'measured'
  - (slope prediction irrelevant)
  - scenarios
    - dynamic_capacity_groups
    - nightly_sleep
    - nissan_leaf
    - sequential
    - sequential_three

- [x] oscillations: drift in stable cur too often on Nissan Leaf
  - can't learn deviations that are symatically > 0.2 ?
  - always resetting all 'except' the last measured

- [x] phase forgetting: short bursts on L2, L3 (inactive)
  - nightly_sleep 
  - perfect_with_lag
