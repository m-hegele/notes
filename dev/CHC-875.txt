Scenarios:

- [x] 1 A gap 
  - fix: properly updating rcur_measured only if currents are 'measured'
  - (slope prediction irrelevant)
  - scenarios
    - dynamic_capacity_groups
    - nightly_sleep
    - nissan_leaf
    - sequential
    - sequential_three

- oscillations: drift in stable cur too often on Nissan Leaf
  - can't learn deviations that are symatically > 0.2 ?
  - always resetting all 'except' the last measured

- full_ev: constantly in prepare-charging
- phase forgetting: short bursts on L2, L3 (inactive)
  - nightly_sleep 
  - perfect_with_lag


boring scenarios:
- mini
- kona_cv_cont
- perfect3_cv_10A
- perfect3_cv_cont
- rcur_sym_opt: even with sym
- vw_egolf_cv_8A
- vw_id3_cv_5A

not full:
- sus_ev_problem
