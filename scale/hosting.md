= Cloud Hosting

[AWS ECS vs. EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/amazon-ecs-vs-amazon-eks-making-sense-of-aws-container-services/)

- ECS: Container Service
  - simplicity
  - integrates with EC2, Elastic Load Balancing, Virtual Private Cloud, IAM
- EKS: Kubernetes Service
  - managed cluster
  - no need to maintain the infrastructure
  - fine-grained control
  - cloud portability (no lock-in)
  - requires Kubernetes knowledge


Compute options (orthogonal):
- AWS Fargate: serverless
- EC2 instances: choose an instance
